Poultry hold a significant positon in agriculture and is one of the consumed products. There is a huge demand for these products and relying on natural methods for hatching eggs proves to be inefficient, causing the development of technologies to increase the poultry production. This project focuses on the development of an egg incubator management system for Zaone poultry farm. the design will ensure optimal environment conditions for successful egg hatching. Useful parameters such as temperature, humidity and rotation of the eggs are maintained at their optimal levels to enhance hatchability rates. The system consists of multiple technologies such as sensors and micro-controllers, whereby the micro-controllers are able to control different environmental conditions of the incubators such as temperature and humidity of the incubator based on the user input feedback or feedback from the sensors such as DHT 22. The system can be remotely monitored via an android or desktop application. Chicken eggs will be used as a case study for testing and evaluating the system and there is high assurance that the system can accurately hatch eggs and prevent other problems that might harm the eggs.
